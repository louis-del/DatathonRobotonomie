Some will work on the python, others on biblio, scenarios etc.

Related to the python coding:

the first goal is to run the semantic_similarity.ipynb jupyter notebook

1. For this, we need to set up the jupyter notebook envirronment:

https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html

Follow:  For new users, we highly recommend installing Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

2. Now we get the dependencies for semantic similarity

Once you have anaconda installed, open an anaconda terminal
then type : pip install sentence-transformers

then cd into the directory where you downloaded the semantic_similarity.ipynb
and type: jupyter notebook

you should see a browser with the file semantic_similarity.ipynb
click on it.  when it opens, go to the kernel menu and "restart and run all"

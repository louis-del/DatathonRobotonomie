A. Semantic similairity
1.  collect photgraphs and 50-100 word texts describing the texts
2.  do pretreatment of text if necessary (is there an advantage or not for pre-structured text?)
3.  (show the photo, user speaks, system transforms speech to text)
4.  perform semantic similarity analysis on texts
5.  perform semantic similarity analysis on images (for the moment we are not sure if this is possible)
6.  create semantic_similarity_matrix
6.  find trajectory in matrix to visit different similar photo pairs
7.  present sequence in a coheret interaction scenario
8.  use french language
9.  use Beam robot to present the interaction

B. Detection and interaction with person

10. Detection and interaction with person1 
11. Recognize face from camera
12. associate recognized face with photos that were provided
13. associate face with other features (name, sex, hobbies)
14. CHATBOT - simple spoken language interaction

C. Integration onto Beam - purely in telepresence mode: sharing screen and microphone

D.  Scenario final:
Two people come up
system recognizes them
then it finds in its database, two photos and stories that are similar from these people

Version simple:  recognize one person, and tell a story using his pictures

Based on "semantic profile" the robot can propose/orient towards new activities

A. Semantic similairity
1.  collect photgraphs and 50-100 word texts describing the texts
2.    (show the photo, user speaks, system transforms speech to text)
3.  perform semantic similarity analysis on texts
4.    do pretreatment of text if necessary (is there an advantage or not for pre-structured text?)
5.  perform semantic similarity analysis on images (for the moment we are not sure if this is possible)
6.  create semantic_similarity_matrix
7.  find trajectory in matrix to visit different similar photo pairs
8.  present sequence in a coheret interaction scenario
9.  use french language
10.  use Beam robot to present the interaction

Detection and interaction with person

8. Detection and interaction with person
9. Recognize face from camera
10. associate recognized face with photos that were provided
11. associate face with other features (name, sex, hobbies)
12. simple spoken language interaction

C.  Scenario final:
Two people come up
system recognizes them
then it finds in its database, two photos and stories that are similar from these people

Version simple:  recognize one person, and tell a story using his pictures

Based on "semantic profile" the robot can propose/orient towards new activities

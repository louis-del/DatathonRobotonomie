## Expectations and Perceptions of Social Robots. 

- In elderly care (ref 1–3) :  
  - Individual-centered expectations	
    - Functional role : helping, assisting to seek help, assisting in remembering things, cognitive stimulation of exercice, mecanichal help (lifting, nursing, dressing…).
    - Emotional role : decrease loneliness, create long term relationship… Is shown to reduced stress markers in elderly when conversation with the robot becomes regular.
-	Society-centered expectations 
    - Increased quality of care
    -	Reduced cost
    -	Increased time coverage (24/7 operability)
    -	Freeing up human resources for high added value care 
    -	Robots as a recipient of Patient reported Outcomes Measures (PROM) in Boumans.(ref 4)
    -	Robots as helpers in the diagnostic path of cognitive impairment in elderly people, in Varrasi.(ref 5)


Chen et al, Alves Oliveira et al., Laitinen et al., Pedersen et al. provide an assessment of the moments or situation where companionship is the most needed and their relative feasibility. (ref 6–9) 

Summarized in Niemela (ref 10)

## Limitations.
Risk of deception and low interaction due to technical limitations (functionality impaired by low connectivity (ref 11); low emotional connection due to minimal emotional mimicry or capacities (ref 12)) 

## Acceptance (ref 10).
-	Positive representation in Europe regarding robots (70%) but much less regarding robots in healthcare (50%). 
-	Older age groups tend to exhibit lower acceptance than younger groups; only 25% of people 55+ were ‘totally comfortable’ with the idea of care robots, compared to 37% of young people aged 15–24 (Special Eurobarometer 427, 2015).
-	Some studies, in contrast, have shown high levels of acceptance of robots if they are used to help people to regain independence when they are old or handicapped (Arras and Cerqui 2005) or if the robots can help in daily household routines or tasks such as heavy lifting and cleaning at home (Ray et al. 2008). According to Broadbent et al. (2009), older people themselves are typically less willing to accept robots in general but are more positive about robots that provide independence and respond to older people’s needs, for instance, the need to compensate for the loss of cognitive abilities. (ref. Cifuentes) 

NB : for a review on acceptance by Whelan. (ref 13)

## Results and Level of Evidence.
Level of evidence for effect size and feasibility measurements in the literature : low. Need for better designed studies, including a control group and larger sample sizes, in Broekens. (ref 14)

Results in dementia : robots for therapy center day care did not improve cognitive or delusional outcomes, both when presented as a humanoid or a pet, raising not only the concept of efficacy but also of safety of the use of robots on cognitive outcomes in dement elderly. (ref 15,16)
Personality traits in robots may improve relational capacity with the users, in Damholdt. (ref 17)

Meta-analysis shows potential effect in elderly but lack of evidence due to low-quality studies. (ref 18) 

Hurtado : acceptance OK, cognitive stimulation seems promising using social robots, especially useful in pandemic times.(ref 19) 
Khosla shows the potential interest of multimodal robots in nursing homes.(ref 20) 

## Use of AI.
Tulsulkar shows how embedded AI for facial recognition helps in detecting emotions and thus fostering interactions with elderly people. (ref 21) 

Varrasi used a robot to help in the diagnostic path of cognitive deficiencies in elderly people.(ref 5)
